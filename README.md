# Diabetic Patient Readmission Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset of diabetic patients to explore patterns related to hospital readmission. The goal is to identify significant factors influencing patient readmissions and apply machine learning models for prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is `diabetic_data.csv`. It contains information about hospital admissions for diabetic patients, including demographics, lab results, medications, and whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - The raw dataset is loaded and pre-processed.
   - Missing values (represented by `?`) are replaced with `NaN`.
   - Features such as `encounter_id`, `patient_nbr`, and categorical variables are transformed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Basic statistical summaries of the dataset.
   - Visualizations using libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to explore relationships between variables.

3. **Feature Scaling and Selection**:
   - Numerical data is normalized using `MinMaxScaler`.
   - Feature importance analysis is conducted to select key predictors of readmission.

4. **Modeling**:
   - The dataset is split into training and test sets.
   - Several machine learning algorithms are applied, such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest Classifier
   - Model evaluation is performed using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## Usage

1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   Ensure that the `diabetic_data.csv` file is available in the working directory or update the path accordingly in the code:
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('diabetic_data.csv')
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   The code can be run cell by cell in Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the results.

## Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
- Analysis of additional features to improve readmission prediction accuracy.
- Cross-validation for model robustness.
