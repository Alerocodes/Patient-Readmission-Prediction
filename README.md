# Diabetic Patient Readmission Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset of diabetic patients to explore patterns related to hospital readmission. The goal is to identify significant factors influencing patient readmissions and apply machine learning models for prediction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is `diabetic_data.csv`. It contains information about hospital admissions for diabetic patients, including demographics, lab results, medications, and whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**:
   - The raw dataset is loaded and pre-processed.
   - Missing values (represented by `?`) are replaced with `NaN`.
   - Features such as `encounter_id`, `patient_nbr`, and categorical variables are transformed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Basic statistical summaries of the dataset.
   - Visualizations using libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to explore relationships between variables.

3. **Feature Scaling and Selection**:
   - Numerical data is normalized using `MinMaxScaler`.
   - Feature importance analysis is conducted to select key predictors of readmission.

4. **Modeling**:
   - The dataset is split into training and test sets.
   - Logistic regression is carried out.
   - Model evaluation is performed using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## Usage

1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   Ensure that the `diabetic_data.csv` file is available in the working directory or update the path accordingly in the code:
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('diabetic_data.csv')
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   The code can be run cell by cell in Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the results.

## Future Improvements
-Data Scaling: The models were developed using a small subset of the original data, with less than 150 instances for the basic model and slightly over 3000 instances for the improved model. Expanding the dataset to include more instances from the original data will enhance the models' robustness and improve performance metrics.

-Clearer Training and Evaluation of Localized Models: The training and evaluation process for the localized models developed for each cluster requires further clarification. Future work should aim to provide a clearer comparison between localized models and a general model that uses the entire dataset.

-Model Performance: Metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy can be further improved by implementing hyperparameter tuning and using more advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods or neural networks.

-Cluster-Specific Models: A deeper analysis of the clusters, combined with a more thorough comparison of cluster-specific models to the general model, will provide insights into whether using localized models per cluster offers significant advantages.
